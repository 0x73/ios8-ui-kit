iOS 8 UI Kit + for Sketch
===========

I've extended and updated the excelente Teehan+Lax built-in UI kit to iOS 8 and I've added some new elements.

To use, simply download the *Download ZIP* button on the right sidebar, unzip and open the .sketch file in Sketch. It's advisable to place this "master" file somewhere safe, and duplicate it when you need to create your own layouts.

## About the kit

* Every single element was made using Sketch.
* You can edit everything to fit your needs.
* I've created symbols out of the elements, so it's easier to add them to your project. No need to copy and paste.
* Feel free to send me some element requests, if I find the time I'll add them to the kit.

####Updated to iOS 8 GM and iPhone 6/6 Plus
